"""


The code starts by taking user input for the number of items (n), the maximum weight the knapsack can hold (maxwt), the profit values of the items (profit), and the weights of the items (weight). The map function is used to convert the input values to integers, and split is used to separate values entered by the user.

The variables wt and max_profit are initialized to keep track of the current weight in the knapsack and the maximum profit achieved so far

The code calculates the profit-to-weight ratio for each item and stores the results in the list ppw (profit per weight).

The code creates an order in which to consider adding items to the knapsack. It does this by finding the index of the maximum profit-to-weight ratio in the ppw list and adding that index to the order list. The maximum value is then set to 0 to avoid selecting it again in the next iteration.

    The code uses a while loop to add items to the knapsack until either the knapsack is full or all items have been considered. If adding an entire item exceeds the knapsack capacity, a fraction of the item is added to fill the knapsack to its maximum weight. The details of the selected items and the corresponding weights, profit values, and fractions are printed.

    Finally, the code prints the maximum profit achieved.

also called as greedy method
