vector add:

This code appears to be a CUDA program for vector addition, where it adds corresponding elements of two arrays h_a and h_b and stores the result in array h_c. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

    It defines the number of elements in the arrays using #define N 5.
    It defines the kernel function gpuAdd which is responsible for performing the vector addition operation.
    In the main function:
        Host arrays h_a, h_b, and h_c are defined.
        Device pointers d_a, d_b, and d_c are declared.
        Memory is allocated for these device pointers using cudaMalloc.
        Arrays h_a and h_b are initialized with some values.
        The input arrays h_a and h_b are copied from host to device memory using cudaMemcpy.
        The kernel function gpuAdd is launched with N blocks and 1 thread per block.
        The result array h_c is copied from device to host memory.
        The result is printed on the console.

However, there is a small issue in the kernel invocation. The block index tid should be the thread index within the block (threadIdx.x)


matrix mul:

    It defines a kernel function gpuMM for matrix multiplication on the GPU.

    In the main function:
        User is prompted to enter a value for the size of the matrix.
        Matrices hA and hB are initialized with values of 4 and 6 respectively.
        Memory is allocated on both the host and device for the matrices.
        Matrices hA and hB are copied from the host to the device.
        The kernel function gpuMM is launched with a grid and block configuration suitable for the size of the matrices.
        The result matrix hC is copied from the device to the host.
        The resultant matrix is printed.

    The program performs matrix multiplication on the GPU using CUDA, leveraging parallelism to accelerate computation.

Certainly! This CUDA code is designed to perform matrix multiplication on the GPU. Let's break down the code step by step:

    Header Includes: The code includes necessary header files like <iostream> and <cuda.h>.

    Macro Definition: The code defines a macro BLOCK_SIZE which determines the size of each thread block in the GPU computation.

    Kernel Function:
        gpuMM kernel function is defined to perform matrix multiplication on the GPU.
        Each thread computes a single element of the output matrix C.
        It utilizes thread and block indices to determine the output matrix element that each thread is responsible for computing.

    Main Function:
        User input for the matrix size (here, it's restricted to a matrix size where N = K * BLOCK_SIZE).
        Memory allocation for host matrices hA, hB, and hC.
        Initialization of matrices hA and hB with specific values (4 and 6 respectively).
        Memory allocation for device matrices dA, dB, and dC.
        Copying data from host to device.
        Configuration of grid and block dimensions for launching the kernel function.
        Printing input matrices hA and hB.
        Launching the kernel function gpuMM to perform matrix multiplication on the GPU.
        Copying the result matrix dC from device to host.
        Printing the result matrix hC.
        Freeing memory allocated on both host and device.

    Kernel Invocation:
        The kernel is invoked with a grid of dimensions K x K and a thread block of dimensions BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE.
        Each thread block handles a submatrix of the input matrices, and each thread computes a single element of the output matrix.

    Matrix Multiplication:
        The matrix multiplication is performed using CUDA parallelism, where each thread computes a single element of the output matrix, allowing for efficient parallel execution on the GPU.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to leverage CUDA to perform matrix multiplication on the GPU, utilizing parallelism to accelerate computation.
