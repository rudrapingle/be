Recurrent neural network (RNN) Use the Google stock prices dataset and design a time series analysis and prediction system using RNN.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks specifically designed to handle sequential data


NumPy is used for array manipulation and mathematical operations
Pandas is used to read the dataset from a CSV file, manipulate the data, and perform operations like sorting and reshaping.
Matplotlib.pyplot is used to visualize the training and validation loss over epochs.
scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing with the MinMaxScaler class, which scales data to a specified range.
TensorFlow is used to build and train the RNN model using the Keras API, which is integrated into TensorFlow.
    These are components of the Keras API, which is now part of TensorFlow.
    The Sequential model allows you to create models layer by layer in a sequential manner.
    The Dense layer is a fully connected layer, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the preceding and succeeding layers.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
LSTM layers are used to build the RNN model for time series prediction.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) Score:These are evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of regression models.


This line of code converts the 'Close' column of the DataFrame df into a NumPy array and then reshapes it into a column vector.
'Close' represents the closing prices of a stock, this column contains numerical values representing the closing prices of the stock over time.
reshape(-1, 1) reshapes the one-dimensional array into a column vector.
The -1 argument in the reshape() function indicates that the length of that dimension should be inferred from the length of the array, while 1 specifies the number of columns in the reshaped array.
This reshaping operation is often necessary when working with machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, which expect input data in certain shapes or formats.



This code snippet uses the MinMaxScaler class from scikit-learn to scale the data to a specified range. Let's break it down:

    MinMaxScaler:
        MinMaxScaler is a preprocessing class from scikit-learn that scales features to a specified range.
We specify the feature_range parameter as (0, 1) to scale the data to the range between 0 and 1.
scaler.fit_transform(data) fits the scaler to the data and transforms the data using the fitted scaler.data is the column vector of stock closing prices obtained earlier.
This process scales the data such that the minimum value becomes 0 and the maximum value becomes 1, with other values scaled proportionally in between


This code snippet splits the scaled data into training and testing sets based on a specified proportion, which is 80% for training and 20% for testing. Let's break it down:

    Calculating the Training Size:
        len(data_scaled) returns the total number of data points in the scaled data.
        len(data_scaled) * 0.8 calculates 80% of the total number of data points, which determines the size of the training set.
        int() is used to convert the calculated value to an integer, ensuring that it represents a valid index.

    Splitting the Data:
        data_scaled[:train_size] slices the scaled data array from the beginning up to (but not including) the index train_size, extracting the data points for the training set.
        data_scaled[train_size:] slices the scaled data array from the index train_size to the end, extracting the remaining data points for the testing set.

    Training and Testing Sets:
        The variable train_data holds the scaled data points for the training set.
        The variable test_data holds the scaled data points for the testing set.
The colon (:) notation is used to slice the array.



This function, create_sequences, generates input-output pairs suitable for training a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Let's go through it step by step:

    Function Signature:
        def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
        This defines a function named create_sequences that takes two parameters:
            data: The input data sequence.
            seq_length: The length of input sequences.

    Initialization:
        X, y = [], []: Initializes empty lists X and y to store input-output pairs.

    Looping Through Data:
        for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):: Iterates over the indices of data, considering sequences of length seq_length.
        data[i:i+seq_length] extracts a sequence of length seq_length starting from index i.

    Creating Input-Output Pairs:
        X.append(data[i:i+seq_length]): Appends the input sequence to the list X.
        y.append(data[i+seq_length]): Appends the output value (next element after the input sequence) to the list y.

    Conversion to NumPy Arrays:
        return np.array(X), np.array(y): Converts the lists X and y to NumPy arrays before returning them.
        This ensures that the output is in the appropriate format for training the RNN model.

Overall, this function generates input-output pairs by sliding a window of length seq_length over the input data sequence data, where each input sequence is associated with the next element in the sequence as the output. These pairs can then be used to train a sequential model, such as an RNN, for tasks like time series prediction.

This code segment utilizes the create_sequences function to generate input-output pairs for both the training and testing datasets. Let's dissect it:

    Sequence Length:
        seq_length = 10: Specifies the length of each input sequence. In this case, it's set to 10, meaning each input sequence will contain 10 consecutive data points.

    Creating Training Sequences:
        X_train, y_train = create_sequences(train_data, seq_length): Calls the create_sequences function with train_data (the scaled training data) and seq_length.
        This generates input-output pairs (X_train and y_train) for the training dataset, where each input sequence (X_train) contains 10 consecutive data points, and the corresponding output (y_train) is the next data point after the sequence.

    Creating Testing Sequences:
        X_test, y_test = create_sequences(test_data, seq_length): Calls the create_sequences function with test_data (the scaled testing data) and seq_length.
        This generates input-output pairs (X_test and y_test) for the testing dataset, following the same process as for the training dataset.

By creating input-output pairs with a specified sequence length, we prepare the data for training and testing recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Each input sequence captures temporal dependencies in the data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks.



This code snippet defines a Sequential model using the Keras API, specifically for building a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. Let's break it down:

    Sequential Model Initialization:
        model = Sequential([...]): Initializes a Sequential model object.

    Model Architecture:
        The model consists of a sequence of layers defined inside the square brackets [...].
        The layers are added sequentially, one after the other.

    LSTM Layers:
        LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)): Adds the first LSTM layer to the model.
            units=50: Specifies the number of LSTM units (or neurons) in the layer.
            return_sequences=True: Indicates that the layer should return the full sequence of outputs rather than just the last output.
            input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1): Specifies the shape of the input data, where X_train.shape[1] represents the length of each input sequence, and 1 indicates the number of features (in this case, it's a univariate time series, so there's only one feature).
        LSTM(units=50): Adds the second LSTM layer to the model. This layer doesn't return sequences by default, meaning it only returns the output at the last time step.
        Both LSTM layers have 50 units, but the second layer does not return sequences, which is typical for the final LSTM layer in a sequence-to-vector setup.

    Dense Layer:
        Dense(units=1): Adds a Dense layer to the model, which is a fully connected layer.
        The units parameter specifies the number of neurons in the Dense layer, which is set to 1 in this case.
        This Dense layer acts as the output layer, producing a single output value.


This code compiles the Keras model with the specified optimizer and loss function. Let's break it down:

    Model Compilation:
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error'): Compiles the Keras model.
        The compile() method configures the model for training by specifying the optimizer and loss function to use.

    Optimizer:
        optimizer='adam': Specifies the optimizer to use during training.
        Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a popular optimization algorithm that combines ideas from RMSprop and momentum.
        It's well-suited for training deep neural networks and is widely used due to its effectiveness and efficiency.

    Loss Function:
        loss='mean_squared_error': Specifies the loss function to use for training.
        Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function for regression problems.
        It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, penalizing large errors more heavily than small errors

This code segment trains the compiled Keras model on the training data. Let's break it down:

    Model Training:
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64): Fits the compiled model to the training data.
        The fit() method trains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations over the entire training dataset).
        It takes the input sequences (X_train) and corresponding target values (y_train) as arguments.

    Epochs:
        epochs=10: Specifies the number of times the entire training dataset will be passed forward and backward through the neural network.
        Each epoch consists of one forward pass (to calculate predictions), followed by one backward pass (to update model parameters).

    Batch Size:
        batch_size=64: Defines the number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
        Using mini-batches (as opposed to processing the entire dataset at once) helps to speed up training and reduces memory consumption.


    y_pred: Contains the predicted values generated by the model for the testing data.
    Each element of y_pred represents the model's prediction for the next data point after each input sequence in X_test.

The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
A lower MSE indicates better model performance, with zero being the ideal value (perfect predictions).

    r2_score(y_test, y_pred): Computes the R^2 score, which represents the proportion of variance in the target variable (y) that is explained by the independent variables (X).
    It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
    A score of 1 means the model perfectly predicts the target variable, while a score of 0 means the model performs no better than simply predicting the mean of the target variable.



These lines of code perform an inverse transformation on the scaled target values (y_test and y_pred) to obtain their original scale. Here's the breakdown:

    Inverse Transformation:
        scaler.inverse_transform(y_test): Uses the inverse_transform() method of the scaler object (scaler) to reverse the scaling applied to the testing target values (y_test).
        This operation converts the scaled target values back to their original scale, allowing them to be interpreted in the context of the original data.

    Original Scale:
        y_test_actual: Contains the testing target values (y_test) in their original scale after the inverse transformation.
        y_pred_actual: Contains the predicted values (y_pred) in their original scale after the inverse transformation.

By performing the inverse transformation, you obtain the original target values and predicted values, which can be interpreted and analyzed in the same scale as the original dataset. This is useful for comparing the model's predictions directly with the actual values and understanding its performance in practical terms.
